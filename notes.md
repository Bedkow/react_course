JSX - syntax for React, combines html in JS and stuff...

components - custom html elements

BEST practice - 1 file for 1 component

App.js is like a main component to bundle all the components and then get exported to index.js and mounted as "root"

component file names - double _CamelCase_ 1st letter capitalized also

a component in React is just a JS function returning JSX code

component after inporting can be used as HTML tag

custom component names MUST start with upper case

component has to always return 1 root statement > easy fix >> wrap everyting in a div

add CSS file with the same name as the component in the component folder

import css into the designated component

"class" property in components == "className"

{} - in components u can run basic JS expressions like "1+1"
